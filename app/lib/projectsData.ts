    overview: {
      problem: "3M's semiconductor materials were scattered across product lines with no unified story. Taiwan's tech industry needed a clear value proposition for total solutions, not individual products.",
      goal: "Create '3M Semiconductor Total Solutions' positioning that showcases our complete portfolio. Launch integrated campaign for Taiwan's largest semiconductor exhibition.",

    overview: {
      problem: "Kaiser's call centers were flying blind. Leadership couldn't see performance issues until customers were already frustrated.",
      goal: "Give managers real-time visibility into what's working and what's not. Build forecasting that helps with staffing decisions.",

    reflection: "This project taught me that great analytics isn't about perfect models â€” it's about making data actionable. The star-rating SLA system worked because it turned complex metrics into something managers could actually use. The real breakthrough was the low-star alert system. Turns out a fast signal beats a perfect report every time. Working with my teammate showed me how collaboration creates better solutions than working alone. The biggest insight? Data storytelling is about creating clarity that drives action, not just pretty charts.",

    description: "This very website you're looking at! Used Cursor and AI to rapidly build a portfolio that positions me as a technical PMM. Refined 30+ micro-interactions because every detail matters in marketing.",
    overview: {
      problem: "Generic portfolio templates wouldn't show that I'm a PMM who actually understands tech. I needed something that proved technical fluency, not just talked about it.",
      goal: "Build a marketing asset that demonstrates both technical execution and strategic thinking. Show I can learn, build, and ship professional-quality work.",

      "Obsessed over 30+ micro-interactions, asking 'does this reinforce my brand?'",
      "Crafted messaging that shows technical capability without losing marketing focus"
    ],
    achievements: [
      "Built and shipped a professional portfolio in just 48 hours",
      "Mastered AI-assisted development workflow with Cursor",
      "Created smooth animations and polished interactions that feel premium",
      "Proved I can learn new tech stacks and deliver production-ready code",

    technologies: ["Next.js", "TypeScript", "Tailwind CSS", "Cursor IDE", "AI Development", "Prompt Engineering", "React Hooks", "CSS Animations"],
    reflection: "Building this taught me that PMM skills translate perfectly to product development. Both are about understanding users, iterating based on feedback, and shipping something valuable. Cursor changed everything, having AI as a development partner felt like having a senior developer available 24/7. The surprising part? My marketing instincts actually made the code better. I found myself obsessing over micro-interactions and asking 'does this enhance the user experience?' Every detail became a branding decision. The biggest lesson: when you approach coding like PMM strategy, with clear goals, user empathy, and attention to detail, you create something that actually serves its purpose.",
